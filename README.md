**The Wordle Game Design and Development using React and TypeScript**

**Design and Development of the Wordle Game:**

**Project Overview**

- Objective: The goal is to create an application that mimics the popular game Wordle. Users will guess a 5-letter word retrieved from an API and receive visual feedback on their guesses.
- Functionality: The application will allow users to make up to 5 guesses. Each guess will be evaluated, and feedback will be provided to help the user identify the correct word.

**Game Mechanics and Key features**

**Game Board:**

- The game board consists of 5 rows, each containing 5 tiles.
- As the user types, their keystrokes are recorded and displayed in the corresponding tiles on the board.

**Feedback:**

- Correct Letter in Correct Location: Highlighted in green. This indicates that the letter is in the correct position in the word.
- Correct Letter in Incorrect Location: Highlighted in yellow. This shows that the letter is in the word but not in the correct position.
- Incorrect Letter: Highlighted in grey. This means the letter is not in the word at all.
- Special Case: If the target word contains a single instance of a letter and the user's guess includes multiple instances of that letter, only one instance should be highlighted.

**End of Game:**

- If the user guesses the word correctly within the 5 attempts, a success message is displayed.
- If the user fails to guess the word after 5 attempts, a failure message is displayed.

**Acceptance Criteria**

**API Integration:**

- The target word must be fetched from the API using the fetchRandomWord() function.
- Any errors from the API must be handled and displayed to the user.

**API Contract:**

- Behavior: This function returns a word of the specified length (default is 5 letters). The API is prone to failure, so error handling is necessary.

**Error Handling:**

- Any errors encountered while fetching the word from the API must be displayed to the user. This ensures that the user is aware of any issues and can understand why the game might not be functioning as expected.

**Additional Considerations:**

- User Experience: The application should be intuitive and user-friendly. Clear instructions and feedback will help users understand how to play the game and what each type of feedback means.
- Design and Aesthetics: The visual design should be appealing and should clearly differentiate between the different types of feedback (green, yellow, grey).
- Performance: The application should be responsive and handle user input efficiently. Any delays in providing feedback or updating the game board could negatively impact the user experience.

**Application Enhancements:**

To further improve the application, the following enhancements can be implemented:

**Restart Game Functionality:**

- Feature: Allow users to restart the game at any point.
- Implementation: Add a "Restart" button that resets the game board, clears all user inputs, and fetches a new target word from the API.
- User Experience: This feature provides users with the flexibility to start over if they wish to try again or if they encounter any issues.

**Word Length Selection:**

- Feature: Enable users to select the length of the target word (between 4-6 letters).
- Implementation: Add a dropdown menu or buttons for users to choose the word length before starting the game. Pass the selected length to the fetchRandomWord() function.
- User Experience: This enhancement adds variety to the game, making it more challenging and engaging by allowing users to customize their experience.

**Input Validation:**

- Feature: Prevent users from entering non-alphabetic characters.
- Implementation: Add input validation to ensure only lowercase alphabetic characters are accepted. Display an error message if invalid characters are entered.
- User Experience: This ensures that the game functions correctly and prevents user frustration caused by invalid inputs.

**Performance Optimization:**

- Feature: Optimize the performance of the application to ensure smooth and responsive gameplay.

**â€¢ Implementation:**

- Minimize re-renders by using efficient state management techniques.
- Lazy load components to reduce initial load time.
- Optimize API calls to handle errors gracefully and reduce latency.
- User Experience: Improved performance will enhance the overall user experience, making the game more enjoyable and responsive.

These enhancements will not only improve the functionality and user experience of the application but also ensure that it is robust, efficient, and engaging for users.
